# Notarize Action

This action Apple-notarizes macOS applications or plug-ins. It does this by submitting your built `.app` (or non-app bundle) to Apple's notarization service.

It uses `notarytool` by default but can be configured to use `altool`. In the case of the latter it will poll the notarization service until it times out or receives a success response.

> **NOTE:** Originally forked from https://github.com/devbotsxyz/xcode-notarize

## Required Inputs

These keys must be set correctly for the action to work.

| Name | Description | Example Value |
|---|---|---|
| `product-path` | The path to the product to notarize.  | `/dist/MyApp.app` |
| `appstore-connect-username` | The AppStore Connect username. | `${{ secrets.NOTARIZATION_USERNAME }}` |
| `appstore-connect-password` | The AppStore Connect password. | `${{ secrets.NOTARIZATION_PASSWORD }}` |
| `appstore-connect-team-id` | The AppStore Connect team id. Only required when using `notarytool`. | `FY8GAUX283` |

## Optional Inputs

These keys are set to sane defaults but can be modified as needed.

| Name | Description | Default | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `appstore-connect-api-key` | The AppStore Connect API Key. | `null` | `${{ secrets.NOTARIZATION_API_KEY }}` |
| `appstore-connect-api-issuer` | The AppStore Connect API Issuer. | `null` | `${{ secrets.NOTARIZATION_API_ISSUER }}` |
| `primary-bundle-id` | A unique identifier that identifies this product notarization. | bundle identifier of the app you are uploading. | `dev.lando.my-app` |
| `tool` | The `xcrun` notarization tool to use. | `notarytool` | `altool` |
| `verbose` | Verbose mode will print Notarization API responses. | `false` | `true` |

##  Usage

### Basic Usage

```yaml
- name: Notarize Release Build
  uses: lando/notarize-action@v2
  with:
    product-path: "/dist/MyApp.app"
    appstore-connect-username: ${{ secrets.NOTARIZATION_USERNAME }}
    appstore-connect-password: ${{ secrets.NOTARIZATION_PASSWORD }}
    appstore-connect-team-id: FY8GAUX283
```

Note that notarization is not the final step. After Apple has notarized your application, you also want to _staple_ a notarization ticket to your product.

This can be done with the [Xcode Staple](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/xcode-staple) action.
